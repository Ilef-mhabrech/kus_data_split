  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": "1. Describe the differences among the three main styles of learning (supervised, reinforcement, and\nunsupervised) and determine which is appropriate to a particular problem domain.\n2. Differentiate the terms of AI, machine learning, and deep learning.\n3. Frame an application as a classification problem, including the available input features and output\nto be predicted (e.g., identifying alphabetic characters from pixel grid input).\n4. Apply two or more simple statistical learning algorithms to a classification task and measure the\nclassifiersâ€™ accuracy.\n5. Identify overfitting in the context of a problem and learning curves and describe solutions to\noverfitting.\n6. Explain how machine learning works as an optimization/search process.\n7. Implement a statistical learning algorithm and the corresponding optimization process to train the\nclassifier and obtain a prediction on new data.\n8. Describe the neural network training process and resulting learned representations.\n74\n9. Explain proper ML evaluation procedures, including the differences between training and testing\nperformance, and what can go wrong with the evaluation process leading to inaccurate reporting of\nML performance.\n10. Compare two machine learning algorithms on a dataset, implementing the data preprocessing and\nevaluation methodology (e.g., metrics and handling of train/test splits) from scratch.\n11. Visualize the training progress of a neural network through learning curves in a well-established\ntoolkit (e.g., TensorBoard) and visualize the learned features of the network.\n12. Compare and contrast several learning techniques (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, naive\nBayes, neural networks, and belief networks), providing examples of when each strategy is\nsuperior.\n13. Evaluate the performance of a simple learning system on a real-world dataset.\n14. Characterize the state of the art in learning theory, including its achievements and shortcomings.\n15. Explain the problem of overfitting, along with techniques for detecting and managing the problem.\n16. Explain the triple tradeoff among the size of a hypothesis space, the size of the training set, and\nperformance accuracy.\n17. Given a real-world application of machine learning, describe ethical issues regarding the choices of\ndata, preprocessing steps, algorithm selection, and visualization/presentation of results."
