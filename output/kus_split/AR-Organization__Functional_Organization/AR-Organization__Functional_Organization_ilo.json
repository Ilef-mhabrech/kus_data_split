    "KA Core": "1. Compare alternative implementation of datapaths in modern computer architectures.\n2. Produce a set of control signals for adding two integers using hardwired and microprogrammed\nimplementations.\n3. Discuss instruction-level parallelism using pipelining and significant hazards that may occur.\n4. Design a complete processor, including datapath and control.\n5. Compute the average cycles per instruction for a given processor and memory system\nimplementation."
