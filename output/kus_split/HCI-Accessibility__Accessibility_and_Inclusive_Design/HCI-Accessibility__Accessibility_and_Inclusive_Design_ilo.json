  "title": "HCI-Accessibility: Accessibility and Inclusive Design",
  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": {
    "CS Core": "1. Identify accessibility challenges faced by people with different disabilities and specify the associated\naccessible and assistive technologies that address them. (See also: AI-Agents, AI-Robotics)\n2. Identify appropriate inclusive design approaches, such as universal design and ability-based\ndesign.\n3. Identify and demonstrate understanding of software accessibility guidelines.\n4. Demonstrate recognition of laws and regulations applicable to accessible design.\n177",
    "KA Core": "5. Apply inclusive frameworks to design, such as universal design and usability and ability-based\ndesign, and demonstrate accessible design of visual, voice-based, and touch-based UIs.\n6. Demonstrate understanding of laws and regulations applicable to accessible design.\n7. Demonstrate understanding of what is appropriate and inappropriate high level of skill during\ninteraction with individuals from diverse populations.\n8. Analyze web pages and mobile apps for current standards of accessibility.",
    "Non-core": "9. Biases towards disability, race, and gender have historically, either intentionally or unintentionally,\ninformed technology design.\na. Find examples.\nb. Consider how those experiences (learnings?) might inform design.\n10. Conceptualize user experience research to identify user needs and generate design insights."
