Single-variable integration: definition, computation rules, integrals of important functions,\nfundamental theorem of calculus, definite vs indefinite, applications (including in probability)\n4. Parametric and polar representations\n5. Taylor series\n6. Multivariate calculus: partial derivatives, gradient, chain-rule, vector valued functions,\n7. Optimization: convexity, global vs local minima, gradient descent, constrained optimization, and\nLagrange multipliers.\n8. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): definition, Euler method, applications to simulation, Monte\nCarlo integration\n9. CS applications: gradient descent for machine learning, forward and inverse kinematics,\napplications of calculus to probability\nNote: the calculus topics listed above are aligned with computer science goals rather than with\ntraditional calculus courses. For example, multivariate calculus is often a course by itself, but computer\nscience undergraduates only need parts of it for machine learning."
