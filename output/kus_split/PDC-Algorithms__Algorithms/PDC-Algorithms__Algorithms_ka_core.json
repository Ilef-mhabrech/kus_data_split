  "KA Core": "3. One of more of the following algorithmic domains. (See also: AL-Strategies):\na. Linear algebra: Vector and matrix operations, numerical precision/stability, applications in\ndata analytics and machine learning.\nb. Data processing: sorting, searching and retrieval, concurrent data structures.\nc. Graphs, search, and combinatorics: Marking, edge-parallelization, bounding, speculation,\nnetwork-based analytics.\nd. Modeling and simulation: differential equations; randomization, N-body problems, genetic\nalgorithms.\ne. Computational logic: satisfiability (SAT), concurrent logic programming.\nf. Graphics and computational geometry: Transforms, rendering, ray-tracing.\ng. Resource management: Allocating, placing, recycling and scheduling processors, memory,\nchannels, and hosts; exclusive vs shared resources; static, dynamic and elastic algorithms;\nReal-time constraints; Batching, prioritization, partitioning; decentralization via work-stealing\nand related techniques.\nh. Services: Implementing web APIs, electronic currency, transaction systems, multiplayer\ngames."
