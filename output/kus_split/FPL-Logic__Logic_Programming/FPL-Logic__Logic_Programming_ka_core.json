  "KA Core": "1. Use a logic language to implement a conventional algorithm.\n2. Use a logic language to implement an algorithm employing implicit search using clauses, relations,\nand cuts.\n3. Use a simple illustrative example to show correspondence between First Order Predicate Logic\n(FOPL) and logic programs using Horn clauses.\n4. Use examples to illustrate the unification algorithm and its role of parameter-passing in query\nreduction.\n5. Use simple logic programs interleaving relations, functions, and recursive programming such as\nfactorial and Fibonacci numbers and simple complex relationships between entities and illustrate\nexecution and parameter-passing using unification and backtracking."
