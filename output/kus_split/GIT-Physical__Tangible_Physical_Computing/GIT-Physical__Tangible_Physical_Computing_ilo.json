    "KA Core": "1. Construct a simple virtual switch or application button and use it to turn on an LED.\n2. Construct a simple system to move a servo in response to sensor data.\n164\n3. Create a circuit and accompanying microcontroller code that uses a light sensor to vary a property\nof something else (e.g., color or brightness of an LED or graphic, position of an external actuator).\n4. Create a circuit with a variable resistor and write a microcontroller program that reads and responds\nto the resistorâ€™s changing values.\n5. Create a 3D form in a CAD package.\na. Show how affine transformations are achieved in the CAD program.\nb. Show an example of instances of an object.\nc. Create a fabrication plan. Provide a cost estimate for materials and time. How will you fabricate\nit?\nd. Fabricate it. How closely did your actual fabrication process match your plan? Where did it\ndiffer?\n6. Write the G- and M-Code to construct a 3D maze and use a CAD/CAM package to check your\nwork.\n7. Decide and defend your decision to use Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, RFID/NFC, or something else for\ninternet connectivity when designing an IoT pill dispenser. Create an IoT pill dispenser.\n8. Distinguish between the different types of fabrication and describe when you would use each."
