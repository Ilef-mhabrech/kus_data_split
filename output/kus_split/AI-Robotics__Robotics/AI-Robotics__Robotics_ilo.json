  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": "(Note: Due to the expense of robot hardware, all of these could be done in simulation or\nwith low-cost educational robotic platforms.)\n1. List capabilities and limitations of today's state-of-the-art robot systems, including their sensors and\nthe crucial sensor processing that informs those systems.\n2. Integrate sensors, actuators, and software into a robot designed to undertake a specific task.\n3. Program a robot to accomplish simple tasks using deliberative, reactive, and/or hybrid control\narchitectures.\n4. Implement fundamental motion planning algorithms within a robot configuration space.\n5. Characterize the uncertainties associated with common robot sensors and actuators; articulate\nstrategies for mitigating these uncertainties.\n6. List the differences among robots' representations of their external environment, including their\nstrengths and shortcomings.\n81\n7. Compare and contrast at least three strategies for robot navigation within known and/or unknown\nenvironments, including their strengths and shortcomings.\n8. Describe at least one approach for coordinating the actions and sensing of several robots to\naccomplish a single task.\n9. Compare and contrast a multi-robot coordination and a human-robot collaboration approach and\nattribute their differences to differences between the problem settings.\n10. Analyze the societal, economic, and ethical issues of a real-world robotics application."
