Security design and engineering, including functional requirements, security subsystems,\ninformation protection, security testing, security assessment, and evaluation (See also: PDC-\nEvaluation, SE-Requirements, SE-Validation)\n6. Security analysis, covering security requirements analysis; security controls analysis; threat\nanalysis; and vulnerability analysis (See also: FPL-Analysis, PDC-Evaluation)\n7. Security attack domains and attack surfaces, e.g., communications and networking, hardware,\nphysical, social engineering, software, and supply chain (See also: NC-Security)\n8. Security attack modes, techniques, and tactics, e.g., authentication abuse; brute force; buffer\nmanipulation; code injection; content insertion; denial of service; eavesdropping; function bypass;\nimpersonation; integrity attack; interception; phishing; protocol analysis; privilege abuse; spoofing;\nand traffic injection (See also: NC-Security, OS-Protection, SE-Validation)\n9. Attestation of software products with respect to their specification and adaptiveness (See also: SE-\nRequirements, SE-Validation)\n10. Design and development of cyber-physical systems\n11. Considerations for trustworthy computing, e.g., tamper resistant packaging, trusted boot, trusted\nkernel, hardware root of trust, software signing and verification, hardware-based cryptography,\nvirtualization, and containers (See also: SE-Construction, SE-Validation)"
