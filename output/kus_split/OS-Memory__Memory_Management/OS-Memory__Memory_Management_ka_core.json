  "KA Core": "1. Review of physical memory, address translation and memory management hardware (See also:\nAR-Memory, MSF-Discrete)\n2. Impact of memory hierarchy including cache concept, cache lookup, and per-CPU caching on\noperating system mechanisms and policy (See also: AR-Memory, SF-Performance)\n210\n3. Logical and physical addressing, address space virtualization (See also: AR-Memory, MSF-\nDiscrete)\n4. Concepts of paging, page replacement, thrashing and allocation of pages and frames\n5. Allocation/deallocation/storage techniques (algorithms and data structure) performance and\nflexibility\nExample concept: Arenas, slab allocators, free lists, size classes, heterogeneously sized pages\n(huge pages)\n6. Memory caching and cache coherence and the effect of flushing the cache to avoid speculative\nexecution vulnerabilities (See also: AR-Organization, AR-Memory, SF-Performance)\n7. Security mechanisms and concepts in memory management including sandboxing, protection,\nisolation, and relevant vectors of attack (See also: SEC-Foundations)\nNon-Core:\n8. Virtual memory: leveraging virtual memory hardware for OS services and efficiency"
