  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": {
    "CS Core": "1. Basic notions: sample spaces, events, probability, conditional probability, Bayesâ€™ rule\na. Translate a prose description of a probabilistic process into a formal setting of sample spaces,\noutcome probabilities, and events.\nb. Calculate the probability of simple events.\nc. Determine whether two events are independent.\nd. Compute conditional probabilities, including through applying (and explaining) Bayes' Rule.\n2. Discrete random variables and distributions\na. Define the concept of a random variable and indicator random variable.\nb. Determine whether two random variables are independent.\nc. Identify common discrete distributions (e.g., uniform, Bernoulli, binomial, geometric).\n3. Continuous random variables and distributions\na. Identify common continuous distributions (e.g., uniform, normal, exponential).\nb. Calculate probabilities using cumulative density functions.\n4. Expectation, variance, law of large numbers, central limit theorem\na. Define the concept of expectation and variance of a random variable.\nb. Compute the expected value and variance of simple or common discrete/continuous random\nvariables.\nc. Explain the relevance of the law of large numbers and central limit theorem to probability\ncalculations.\n5. Conditional distributions and expectation\na. Explain the distinction between joint, marginal, and conditional distributions.\nb. Compute marginal and conditional distributions from a full distribution, for both discrete and\ncontinuous random variables.\nc. Compute conditional expectations for both discrete and continuous random variables.\n6. Applications to computing\na. Describe how probability can be used to model real-life situations or applications, such as\npredictive text, hash tables, and quantum computation.\nb. Apply probabilistic processes to solving computational problems, such as through randomized\nalgorithms or in security contexts.\n189"
