Progress properties including lock-free, wait-free, fairness, priority scheduling, interactions\nwith consistency, reliability\nb. Performance with respect to contention, granularity, convoying, scaling\nc. Non-blocking data structures and algorithms\nd. Ownership and resource control\ne. Lock variants and alternatives: sequence locks, read-write locks; Read-Copy-Update (RCU),\nreentrancy; tickets; controlling spinning versus blocking\nf. Transaction-based control: Optimistic and conservative\ng. Distributed locking: reliability\nh. Alternatives to barriers: Clocks; counters, virtual clocks; dataflow and continuations; futures\nand RPC; consensus-based, gathering results with reducers and collectors\ni. Speculation, selection, cancellation; observability and security consequences\nj. Resource control using semaphores and condition variables\nk. Control flow: Scheduling computations, series-parallel loops with (possibly elected) leaders,\npipelines and streams, nested parallelism\nl. Exceptions and failures. Handlers, detection, timeouts, fault tolerance, voting"
