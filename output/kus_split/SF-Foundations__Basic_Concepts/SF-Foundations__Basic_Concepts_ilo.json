    "CS Core": "1. Describe the differences between digital and analog systems, and between discrete and continuous\nsystems. Can give real-world examples of these systems.\n2. Describe computations as a system characterized by a known set of configurations with transitions\nfrom one unique configuration (state) to another (state).\n3. Describe the distinction between systems whose output is only a function of their input (stateless)\nand those with memory/history (stateful).\n4. Develop state machine descriptions for simple problem statement solutions (e.g., traffic light\nsequencing, pattern recognizers).\n5. Describe a computer as a state machine that interprets machine instructions.\n293\n6. Explain how a program or network protocol can also be expressed as a state machine and that\nalternative representations for the same computation can exist.\n7. Derive the time-series behavior of a state machine from its state machine representation (e.g., TCP\nconnection management state machine).\n8. Write a simple sequential problem and a simple parallel version of the same program.\n9. Evaluate the performance of simple sequential and parallel versions of a program with different\nproblem sizes and be able to describe the speed-ups achieved.\n10. Describe on an execution timeline how parallelism events and operations can take place\nsimultaneously (i.e., at the same time). Explain how work can be performed in less elapsed time if\nthis can be exploited."
