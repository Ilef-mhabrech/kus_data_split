    "CS Core": "292\n1. Describe the basic building blocks of computers and their role in the historical development of\ncomputer architecture.\n2. Design a simple logic circuit using the fundamental building blocks of logic design to solve a simple\nproblem (e.g., adder).\n3. Describe how computing systems are constructed of layers upon layers, based on separation of\nconcerns, with well-defined interfaces, hiding details of low layers from the higher layers.\n4. Describe that hardware, OS, VM, and application are additional layers of interpretation/processing.\n5. Describe the mechanisms of how errors are detected, signaled back, and handled through the\nlayers.\n6. Construct a simple program (e.g., a TCP client/server) using methods of layering, error detection\nand recovery, and reflection of error status across layers.\n7. Identify bugs in a layered program by using tools for program tracing, single stepping, and\ndebugging.\n8. Understand the concept of strong vs weak scaling, i.e., how performance is affected by the scale of\nthe problem vs the scale of resources to solve the problem. This can be motivated by simple, real-\nworld examples."
