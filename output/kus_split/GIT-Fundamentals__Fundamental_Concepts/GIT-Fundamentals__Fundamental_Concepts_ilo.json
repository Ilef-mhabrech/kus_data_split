  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": {
    "CS Core": "1. Identify common uses of digital presentation to humans (e.g., computer graphics, sound).\n2. Describe how analog signals can be reasonably represented by discrete samples, for example, how\nimages can be represented by pixels.\n3. Compute the memory requirement for storing a color image given its resolution.\n4. Create a graphic depicting how the limits of human perception affect choices about the digital\nrepresentation of analog signals.\n5. Indicate when and why you should use each of the following common file formats: JPG, PNG, MP3,\nMP4, and GIF.\n6. Describe color models and their use in graphics display devices.\n7. Compute the memory requirements for a multi-second movie (lasting n seconds) displaying at a\nspecific framerate (f frames per second) at a specified resolution (r pixels per frame)\n8. Compare and contrast digital video to analog video.\n9. Describe the basic process of producing continuous motion from a sequence of discrete frames\n(sometimes called “flicker fusion”).\n10. Describe a possible visual misrepresentation that could result from digitally sampling an analog\nworld.\n11. Compute memory space requirements based on resolution and color coding.\n12. Compute time requirements based on refresh rates and rasterization techniques.",
    "KA Core": "13. Design a user interface and an alternative for persons with color perception deficiency.\n14. Construct a simple graphical user interface using a graphics library."
