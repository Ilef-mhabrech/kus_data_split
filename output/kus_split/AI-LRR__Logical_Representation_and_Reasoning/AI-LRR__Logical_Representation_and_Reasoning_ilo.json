  "title": "AI-LRR: Logical Representation and Reasoning",
  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": "1. Translate a natural language (e.g., English) sentence into a predicate logic statement.\n2. Convert a logic statement into clausal form.\n3. Apply resolution to a set of logic statements to answer a query.\n4. Compare and contrast the most common models used for structured knowledge representation,\nhighlighting their strengths and weaknesses.\n5. Identify the components of non-monotonic reasoning and its usefulness as a representational\nmechanism for belief systems.\n6. Compare and contrast the basic techniques for representing uncertainty.\n7. Compare and contrast the basic techniques for qualitative representation.\n8. Apply situation and event calculus to problems of action and change.\n9. Explain the distinction between temporal and spatial reasoning, and how they interrelate.\n10. Explain the difference between rule-based, case-based, and model-based reasoning techniques.\n11. Define the concept of a planning system and how it differs from classical search techniques.\n12. Describe the differences between planning as search, operator-based planning, and propositional\nplanning, providing examples of domains where each is most applicable.\n13. Explain the distinction between monotonic and non-monotonic inference."
