  "title": "FPL-Abstraction: Program Abstraction and Representation",
  "KA Core": "1. Illustrate the scope of variables and visibility using simple programs.\n2. Illustrate different types of parameter-passing using simple pseudo programming language.\n3. Explain side-effect using global and nonlocal variables and how to fix such programs.\n4. Explain how programs that process other programs treat the other programs as their input data.\n5. Describe a grammar and an abstract syntax tree for a small language.\n6. Describe the benefits of having program representations other than strings of source code.\n7. Implement a program to process some representation of code for some purpose, such as an\ninterpreter, an expression optimizer, or a documentation generator."
