  "KA Core": "5. One or more of the following properties and extensions\na. Topologies: Unicast, Multicast, Mailboxes, Switches; Routing via hardware and software\ninterconnection networks\nb. Media concurrency properties: Ordering, consistency, idempotency, overlapping\ncommunication with computation\nc. Media performance: Latency, bandwidth (throughput) contention (congestion),\nresponsiveness (liveness), reliability (error and drop rates), protocol-based progress (acks,\ntimeouts, mediation)\nd. Media security properties: integrity, privacy, authentication, authorization (See also: SEC-\nSecure Coding)\ne. Data formats: Marshaling, validation, encryption, compression\nf. Channel policies: Endpoints, sessions, buffering, saturation response (waiting vs dropping),\nrate control\ng. Multiplexing and demultiplexing many relatively slow I/O devices or parties; completion-\nbased and scheduler-based techniques; async-await, select and polling APIs\nh. Formalization and analysis of channel communication; for example, CSP\ni. Applications of queuing theory to model and predict performance.\nj. Memory models: sequential and release/acquire consistency\nk. Memory management; including reclamation of shared data; reference counts and\nalternatives\nl. Bulk data placement and transfer; reducing message traffic and improving locality;\noverlapping data transfer and computation; impact of data layout such as array-of-structs vs\nstruct-of-arrays\nm. Emulating shared memory: distributed shared memory, Remote Direct Memory Access\n(RDMA)\nn. Data store consistency: Atomicity, linearizability, transactionality, coherence, causal\nordering, conflict resolution, eventual consistency, blockchains\no. Faults, partitioning, and partial failures; voting; protocols such as Paxos and Raft.\np. Design tradeoffs among consistency, availability, partition (fault) tolerance; impossibility of\nmeeting all at once\nq. Security and trust: Byzantine failures, proof of work and alternatives\n221"
