  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": {
    "CS Core": "1. Basic definitions and concepts: populations, samples, measures of central tendency, variance\na. Create and interpret frequency tables.\nb. Display data graphically and interpret graphs (e.g., histograms).\nc. Recognize, describe, and calculate means, medians, quantiles (location of data).\nd. Recognize, describe, and calculate variances, interquartile ranges (spread of data).\n2. Univariate data: point estimation, confidence intervals\na. Formulate maximum likelihood estimation (in linear-Gaussian settings) as a least-squares\nproblem.\nb. Calculate maximum likelihood estimates.\nc. Calculate maximum a posteriori estimates and make a connection with regularized least\nsquares.\nd. Compute confidence intervals as a measure of uncertainty.",
    "KA Core": "3. Sampling, bias, adequacy of samples, Bayesian vs frequentist interpretations\n4. Multivariate data: estimation, correlation, regression\na. Formulate the multivariate maximum likelihood estimation problem as a least-squares problem.\nb. Interpret the geometric properties of maximum likelihood estimates.\nc. Derive and calculate the maximum likelihood solution for linear regression.\nd. Derive and calculate the maximum a posteriori estimates for linear regression.\ne. Implement both maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimates in the context of a\npolynomial regression problem.\nf. Formulate and understand the concept of data correlation (e.g., in 2D)\n5. Data transformation: dimension reduction, smoothing\na. Formulate and derive Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as a least-squares problem.\nb. Geometrically interpret PCA (when solved as a least-squares problem).\nc. Describe when PCA works well (one can relate back to correlated data).\nd. Geometrically interpret the linear regression solution (maximum likelihood).\n6. Statistical models and algorithms\na. Apply PCA to dimensionality reduction problems.\nb. Describe the tradeoff between compression and reconstruction power.\n190\nc. Apply linear regression to curve-fitting problems.\nd. Explain the concept of overfitting.\ne. Discuss and apply cross-validation in the context of overfitting and model selection (e.g., degree\nof polynomials in a regression context)."
