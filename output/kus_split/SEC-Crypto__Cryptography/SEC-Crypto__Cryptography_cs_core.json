  "title": "SEC-Crypto: Cryptography",
  "CS Core": "1. Differences between algorithmic, applied, and mathematical views of cryptography\n2. Mathematical preliminaries: modular arithmetic, Euclidean algorithm, probabilistic independence,\nlinear algebra basics, number theory, finite fields, complexity, asymptotic analysis (See also: MSF-\nDiscrete, MSF-Linear)\n3. Basic cryptography: symmetric key and public key cryptography (See also: AL-Foundational, MSF-\nDiscrete)\n4. Basic cryptographic building blocks, including symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption,\nhashing, and message authentication (See also: MSF-Discrete)\n5. Classical cryptosystems, such as shift, substitution, transposition ciphers, code books, and\nmachines (See also: MSF-Discrete)\n6. Kerckhoffâ€™s principle and use of vetted libraries (See also: SE-Construction)\n7. Usage of cryptography in real-world applications, e.g., electronic cash, secure channels between\nclients and servers, secure electronic mail, entity authentication, device pairing, steganography, and\nvoting systems (See also: NC-Security, GIT-Image)"
