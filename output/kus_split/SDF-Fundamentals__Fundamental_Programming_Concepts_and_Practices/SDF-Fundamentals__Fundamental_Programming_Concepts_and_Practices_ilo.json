  "Illustrative Learning Outcomes": {
    "CS Core": "In these learning outcomes, the term \"develop\" means \"design, write, test, and debug.\"\n1. Develop programs that use the fundamental programming constructs: assignment and expressions,\nbasic I/O, conditional and iterative statements.\n2. Develop programs using functions with parameter passing.\n3. Develop programs that effectively use the different structured data types provided in the language\nlike arrays/lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n4. Develop programs that use file I/O to provide data persistence across multiple executions.\n5. Develop programs that use language-provided libraries and frameworks (where applicable).\n6. Develop programs that use APIs to access or update data (e.g., from the web).\n7. Develop programs that create simple classes and instantiate objects of those classes (if supported\nby the language).\n8. Explain the concept of recursion and identify when and how to use it effectively.\n9. Develop recursive functions.\n10. Develop programs that can handle runtime errors.\n11. Read a given program and explain what it does.\n12. Write comments for a program or a module specifying what it does.\n13. Trace the flow of control during the execution of a program.\n14. Use appropriate terminology to identify elements of a program (e.g., identifier, operator, operand)."
