Entertainment, business, and scientific applications: e.g., visual effects, generative imagery,\ncomputer vision, machine learning, user interfaces, video editing, games and game engines,\ncomputer-aided design and manufacturing, data visualization, and virtual/augmented/mixed\nreality\nb. Intellectual property, deep fakes, facial recognition, privacy (See also: SEP-DEIA, SEP-Privacy,\nSEP-IP, SEP-Professional-Ethics)\n2. Graphic output\na. Displays (e.g., LCD)\nb. Printers\nc. Analog film\nd. Concepts\ni. Resolution (e.g., pixels, dots)\nii. Aspect ratio\niii. Frame rate\n3. Human vision system\na. Tristimulus reception (RGB)\nb. Eye as a camera (projection)\nc. Persistence of vision (frame rate, motion blur)\nd. Contrast (detection, Mach banding, dithering/aliasing)\ne. Non-linear response (dynamic range, tone mapping)\nf. Binocular vision (stereo)\ng.
