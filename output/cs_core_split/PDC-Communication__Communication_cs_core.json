  "CS Core": "1. Media\na. Varieties: channels (message passing or I/O), shared memory, heterogeneous, data stores\nb. Reliance on the availability and nature of underlying hardware, connectivity, and protocols;\nlanguage support, emulation (See also: AR-IO)\n2. Channels\na. Explicit (usually named) party-to-party communication media\nb. APIs: Sockets, architectural, language-based, and toolkit constructs, such as Message\nPassing Interface (MPI), and layered constructs such as Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (See\nalso: NC-Fundamentals)\nc. I/O channel APIs\n3. Memory\n220\na. Shared memory architectures in which parties directly communicate only with memory at\ngiven addresses, with extensions to heterogeneous memory supporting multiple memory\nstores with explicit data transfer across them; for example, GPU local and shared memory,\nDirect Memory Access (DMA)\nb. Memory hierarchies: Multiple layers of sharing domains, scopes, and caches; locality:\nlatency, false-sharing\nc. Consistency properties: Bitwise atomicity limits, coherence, local ordering\n4. Data Stores\na. Cooperatively maintained data structures implementing maps and related ADTs\nb. Varieties: Owned, shared, sharded, replicated, immutable, versioned"
