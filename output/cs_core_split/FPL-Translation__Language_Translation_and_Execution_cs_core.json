  "title": "FPL-Translation: Language Translation and Execution",
  "CS Core": "1. Explain and understand the differences between compiled, JIT, and interpreted language\nimplementations, including the benefits and limitations of each.\n2. Differentiate syntax and parsing from semantics and evaluation.\n139\n3. Use BNF and extended BNF to specify the syntax of simple constructs such as if-then-else, type\ndeclaration and iterative constructs for known languages such as C++ or Python.\n4. Illustrate the parse tree using a simple sentence/arithmetic expression.\n5. Illustrate translation of syntax diagrams to BNF/extended BNF for simple constructs such as if-then-\nelse, type declaration, iterative constructs, etc.\n6. Illustrate ambiguity in parsing using nested if-then-else/arithmetic expression and show resolution\nusing precedence order.\nKA-Core:\n7. Discuss the benefits and limitations of garbage collection, including the notion of reachability."
